I run this project in my spare time, and it is one of many open source projects I actively manage. There is a lot of work left to do, and I would really appreciate the help!

# Wish List #

The following areas need to be improved, and help would be very greatly appreciated:
  * **Sound** using the HTML5 [Web Audio API](http://chromium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples/audio/specification/specification.html). See my initial prototype [here](http://goo.gl/JpVEh).
  * Improve performance, especially for the CR-48 users
  * Improve game compatibility and rendering (specifically Star Tropics)
  * Ability to Sync games from Chrome to Google Docs and back
  * Ability to save game snapshots and restore
  * Add a full-screen mode, pause button, reset button
  * i18n / translate to languages other than English
