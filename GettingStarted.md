# Getting the Code #

You can checkout the code from our [Subversion Repository](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-nes-port/source/checkout). Currently we have two different eclipse projects available:
  * Emulator only (see /branches/gwt-nes-port)
  * 8-bit-hits Application, includes the emulator, screens, game storage, etc (see /trunk/gwt-nes-port)

Note: you will need to include a copy of the [gwt-mobile-webkit](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-mobile-webkit/) library, which is used to provide local storage for our games.

# Chrome Web Store #

In addition to the source code, you can download a free packaged version of the application, called 8-bit-hits, from the Chrome Web Store. Simply go to the [8-bit-hits page](http://goo.gl/OQvYv) in the Chrome Web Store and click the install button:

... and voila, you will then see the 8-bit-hits icon on your home screen:
